For this project, I have created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes, written to and retrieved from a backend JSON file created by me.

 ## Introduction 
 For this project the frontend was already provided,but I added some styling to it without changing the javascript part of it.Along with it, I built the backend part of the App and connected the two together.I created the routes, namely,__apiRoutes.js__  where the get post and delete functions are created and implemented.Also, the __htmlRoutes.js__ which routes the file to the correct files.At the end, the __server.js__ file is used to set up the port and list it as a localhost.All the notes are returned and saved as JSON.

 ## Deployed Application
 The following shows how I created this app and how it generates the file. I may make some chagnges to the code to make it more clean. But more or less, it is almost an exact representation of the code

 [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://notetakerdr.herokuapp.com/)
 
 Else we can also run the app from the terminal by using running 
 
 ```
node server.js
```
And then search for the localhost:2020 in your browser
