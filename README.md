For this project, I have created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes, written to and retrieved from a backend JSON file created by me.

 ## Introduction 
 I have worked and added functions to the code where a part of it was already provide to me.This app generates a __README__ file based off the  user input. This app is mainly working from the "index.js" file and parts of it have been exported from "generateMarkdown"  file. Both of them being JavaScript codes.In order to start the code, you need to install the inquirer package and for that you should have npm installed. If not then you can do it using the following commands that need to be written in your terminal. 
 ```
npm init
```
```
npm install
```

 
 The application will begin by typing the following command in the terminal and pressing the "enter" key:
 ```
node index.js
```
The user will be greeted with a welcome message and will be then prompted to answer the questions.Once the user answers all the questions, a __README__ file is generated.

 ## Deployed Application
 The following shows how I created this app and how it generates the file. I may make some chagnges to the code to make it more clean. But more or less, it is almost an exact representation of the code

 Else we can also run the app from the terminal by using running 
 
 ```
node index.js
```
And then search for the localhost:2020 in your browser
